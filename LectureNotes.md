## JSON
We learned what **.JSON** files are used for: mainly it allows us to transfer data between platforms and programs. It works similarly to vocabulary in python.
  - JSON files can't have a comma after the last value
  - use _null_ rather than _none_
  - to add several values to each key create a list by putting square brackets
  
## GIT
The full description appears in the [README.md](https://github.com/Code-Maven/wis-advanced-python-2021-2022/blob/main/README.md) file on github.

- Turn a github directory into a website, based on a markdown file

## HTML
- small icons = "Favicon"
- how to change styles
- HTML vs CSS
- use docs directory instead of root

## HTML/CSS frameworks
Use too build a website that looks much better
- Bulma
- Bootstrap

## Flask
A web framework written in python. See [slides](https://code-maven.com/slides/python/flask)
- need to install (pip install flask)
- a decorator in python (@) changes the behaviour of the function after it
- to run, write in the terminal of Pycharm:
  - set FLASK_APP=app</br>  set FLASK_DEBUG=1</br> flask run 
- We talked about testing the flask app
- by using "**request**" you can create an html page based on input (meaning you can also request data)
- [**client**](https://code-maven.com/slides/python/flask-echo-get-client): call the flask app code from other python code (program)
- GET method vs POST method: I think GET will change the URL to whatever you wrote. (relevant [slide](https://code-maven.com/slides/python/flask-get-and-post-in-two-functions))
