## JSON
We learned what **.JSON** files are used for: mainly it allows us to transfer data between platforms and programs. It works similarly to vocabulary in python.
  - JSON files can't have a comma after the last value
  - use _null_ rather than _none_
  - to add several values to each key create a list by putting square brackets
